Installation of Visual Studio Code:

1.	Downloading the installer: Visited the official VS Code download page and chose the option for Windows.
2.	Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded (.exe file).
3.	Accept the license agreement and follow the on-screen instructions. 

First-time Setup for Optimal Coding
Here are some of the initial adjustments I did for a better experience:
•	Themes and Fonts: 
•	Extensions: Install extensions for your programming language and desired functionalities.

User Interface Overview
VS Code's interface consists of several key components:
•	Activity Bar: Located on the left, it provides access to various functionalities like debugging, extensions, and Git.
•	Side Bar: This houses the Explorer, Search, Source Control (Git), and other tools depending on installed extensions.
•	Editor Group: The central area where you write and edit code.
•	Status Bar: Located at the bottom, it displays information like current line number, indentation mode, and Git status.

Using the Command Palette
The Command Palette is a powerful tool to access features and settings quickly. 
Here's how to use it: 
•	Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or go to View > Command Palette).
•	Functionality: Type keywords to find and execute commands. For example, search for "New File" to create a new file or "Format Document" to format the code.

Extensions in VS Code
Extensions enhance VS Code's functionality. Here's how to manage them:
•	Role: Extensions provide features for specific languages (e.g., Python), debuggers, linters, and more.
•	Find and Install: Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). Browse the marketplace or search for extensions by name.
•	Manage: You can install, update, disable, and remove extensions from the Extensions view.
•	Web Development Examples: Popular extensions for web development include: 
o	Live Server for previewing web pages without a server.
o	ESLint for identifying and fixing JavaScript errors.
o	Debugger for Chrome to debug code running in Chrome.

Using the Integrated Terminal
The integrated terminal allows you to execute commands within VS Code. Here's how to use it:
•	Open: Go to Terminal > New Terminal (or use Ctrl+ followed by ~).
•	Advantages: 
o	Integrates seamlessly with VS Code for tasks like running code or Git commands.
o	Avoids switching between VS Code and a separate terminal window.

File and Folder Management
VS Code provides functionalities for managing files and folders:
•	Create: Use the File menu or right-click in the Explorer view.
•	Open: Double-click a file in the Explorer or use the File > Open File option.
•	Navigation: Use the Explorer view to navigate directories, or use the built-in search functionality.

Settings and Preferences
Settings allow you to personalize VS Code's behavior.
Here's how to access them:
•	Location: Go to File > Preferences > Settings.
•	Customization Examples: 
o	Change the theme: Search for "Theme" and select your preference.
o	Adjust font size: Search for "Font Size" and set the desired size.
o	Modify keybindings: Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts" to remap keyboard shortcuts for various actions.

Debugging in VS Code
VS Code offers debugging capabilities to identify and fix errors in your code. 
Here's a basic setup:
1.	Install a debugger extension for your programming language.
2.	Set breakpoints (lines where execution should pause).
3.	Start debugging using the Debug view.
•	Features: VS Code offers features like stepping through code line-by-line, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints.

Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
 How to use VS Code with Git for version control, including initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub:
1. Initializing a Git Repository:
•	Open your project folder in VS Code.
•	Go to the Source Control tab.
•	Search for "Git: Initialize Repository" and select it. This creates a new. git folder in your project directory, marking it as a Git 
repository.

2. Making Commits:
•	After making changes to your code, stage those changes for the next commit. You can stage specific files (right-click on the file in the Source Control view and select "Stage Changes") or stage all changes at once.
•	Open the Source Control view again.
•	In the Staged Changes section, you'll see the list of files you've staged.
•	Click on the message box below the Staged Changes section and write a clear and concise commit message describing your changes.
•	Click the green checkmark button to create a commit with your staged changes and message.

3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:
•	Make sure you have a GitHub account and a remote repository set up for your project.
•	In the Source Control view, under the Remotes section, you should see the name of your remote repository.
•	Click on the ellipsis (...) next to the remote repository name and select "Publish Branch." This will push your local commits to the corresponding branch on your remote GitHub repository.
